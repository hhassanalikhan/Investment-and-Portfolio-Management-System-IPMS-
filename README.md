# Investment-and-Portfolio-Management-System-IPMS-It was a semester long project in service oriented computing course. I had to develop an
Investment and Portfolio Management System (IPMS) that is built on top of service-oriented architecture to provide customized solutions for asset management, pension/retirement plan management, trading management, and fund distribution and reporting processes. After basic services I had developed composite services using WSDLs of local and 3rd party services to automate most processes using BPEL.
